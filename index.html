                <h3>Go Skating</h3>
                <p> Twirl the night away under a canopy of lights at the zoo’s skating rink,
                  sponsored by Mahogany Lakeside Living. Skating becomes a musical party every Thursday,
                  Friday and Saturday night when a DJ joins the celebrations. No skates? No worries.
                  There are free skate rentals (courtesy of KidsSport Calgary) available on site to make
                  sure everyone has the chance to go for a lap.</p>

                <p>ZOOLIGHTS gets active with a new Pedal Power activity, where participants can take a virtual tour of Calgary’s cycle paths by powering a screen on a stationary bike. This challenge will get visitors moving while demonstrating how much electricity is necessary for everyday activities. Education on energy conservation? Check. And it’s a fun way to challenge your friends — you’re off to the races! Come see all that zone four has to offer!</p>

                <h3>Become a Who in Zooville</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 15px;">The ENMAX Conservatory takes on a new theme each year, and this season it’s been transformed into Zooville. Whimsy and delight come to life in these lush gardens, where visitors young and old can dress up like Who characters (with free face painting) in the Zooville Salon. Little ones will enjoy Story Time in the butterfly gardens from Thursday to Sundays. If guests are looking for an encounter with a certain man in green, he’s creeping around every Thursday night.</p>

                <p>The winter weather has been nipping at our noses, so take a break in the tropical environment of the ENMAX Conservatory. Zooville has transformed the garden rainforest, adding pops of colour and sparkle to the scene. The dazzling 15-ft. tree is sure to impress, and is the perfect spot for a group selfie. Stay awhile and come take a break in zone five.</p>
